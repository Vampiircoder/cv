    <h3>Books & learning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> My first programming education started with modding and changing data in some pc games. All thou you can't
            really
            call it modding but I googled and learned how i can manipulate games data.</li>
        <li> I have learned about HTML from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> Damian Dapit (made the basics
            pretty clear), then i bought extra course from
            Angela Yu (this course is not yet finished so i can't really say what i will learn)</li>
        <li>I learned about MySQL from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY"> youtube</a> made by
            freeCodeCamp, Mike Dane (Excellent tutorial and intro into SQL, I
            learned how to create db and how to use dbms), this has increased my intrests in db.</li>
        <li>My goal currently with db is to great an AI or a machine learning that will calculate minimum required
            amount
            of
            strength to defeat a monster with out getting wounded. This is an excellent challenge because it has over 30
            factors to consider, it requires a huge amount of data that is why I will build it into a website. So other
            people can start feeding it data. After sometime I want the AI start asking questions from people to start
            improving itself. This challenge will force me to create a website that has a login, it will have several db
            that store information, it will have to be secure, it will teach me python (for connecting SQL to website),
            it
            will let me know what UI works and what doesn't. </li>
    </ul>
