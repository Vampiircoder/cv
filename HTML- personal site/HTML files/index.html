                    I am Risto. All thou I have started my hobby in computer science recently started learning 1 year
                    ago (started 2021). My friends who started whining that I am not living up to my full potential and
                    change your life. <br>
                    For me motivation has always been a fickle thing and this is my way of keeping my motivation up. I
                    found the most motivating thing that I have recently heard was: How to you know this? How to you
                    know that? Why do you know that? And you are lying about your age you can't know so much stuff. This
                    has been a serious motivation boost for me. But as we know words soon be forgotten and the effect
                    gone. I will share what, I have changed in my life and lifestyle. Check lifestyle changes down below
                    <br>
                    Well all of this will change and know if I have stopped updating, changing it then I have stopped
                    improving.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>Life</h3>
    <p>As a child I was really energetic and got along with everyone. When I grew older I still got along with most
        people but as with everyone I changed in my teenage years. Guess those were those dreaded hormones. Till age 17
        I really had no goals or idea where to reach.</p>
    <p>I read or heard somewhere, if you want to know where you are heading or what the end will be then look at your
        superiors. So I saw that the end would not satisfy me and I would want more out of life.</p>
    <p>My first work experience was as a waiter, it was fun but I was kind of a dick there. At that time I was studying
        to become a chef. At summer I was working as and group entertainer for companies and groups. I made games for
        them and helped them to have a great time on their vacation.</p>
    <p>My first "business" education was from Amway, I went to some meetings and lectures. I tried it for 1 year maybe
        but I saw that this was not for me. I was lucky to be recruited by nice people, so my experience with them was a
        nice one. All thou it was not for me I was grateful for it.</p>
    <p>Through a entertainment ship called M/S Monica. I started to widen my skills and gaining new ones. I took part in
        several business lectures made by Peeter Pärtel and Felor Sakias (most of them were related to real estate) ,
        the most memorable
        was creating a "brown paper". It is a detailed overview of the actions and works of the company, through it you
        could just recreate the business.</p>
    <p>Then I got an opportunity to run my brothers cafe. It was hard as hell. I was unorganized, half of the time I had
        no idea what i was doing. The most important lesson I learned from there was it is extremely hard to work with
        family and before acting <strong>THINK</strong>. (Why is it hard to work with family? I guess it is because you
        have so much ammunition to throw at one-another. When some little thing goes awry, then you start bringing up
        unsolved issues from the past. As they say here "Who brings up old incidents may he lose his eye.") </p>
    <p>After that I got my first governmental job working for university. Lets say I have met nice people but sadly
        there were few to be found there. Lot of lies (first lie was "Yes, everything here is done by the book", they
        meant you have to do everything by the book and if you dare criticize or bring up flaws in their work then you
        are lazy and stupid.) and cover ups. Now I am planning to leave there.</p>
    <p><strong>TO BE CONTINUED</strong></p>

    <h3>Changes in lifestyle and studying</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Daily workout in the morning. Currently I am up to 25x push-ups, 25x weight lifting each arm weight is about
            11 kg, 20x sit-ups and 20x crouches.</li>
        <li>Daily studying even if I am on the move. I will try to listen or watch a video about programming or about
            computers</li>
        <li>I am starting to stop the excessive thinking that involves "I am going to start doing it soon, or in a
            while, or after this" and just to it. (These are the small things, that are extremely easy to do, that
            improve your daily life and only take 5 minutes or even less). My logic behind this is that if I have done
            it then I am not obsessing about it anymore. Thus my focus is not split and I will accomplice more in
            shorted time expanse. </li>
    </ul>



    <h3>Books & learning</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li> My first programming education started with modding and changing data in some pc games. All thou you can't
            really
            call it modding but I googled and learned how i can manipulate games data.</li>
        <li> I have learned about HTML from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> Damian Dapit (made the basics
            pretty clear), then i bought extra course from
            Angela Yu (this course is not yet finished so i can't really say what i will learn)</li>
        <li>I learned about MySQL from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY"> youtube</a> made by
            freeCodeCamp, Mike Dane (Excellent tutorial and intro into SQL, I
            learned how to create db and how to use dbms), this has increased my intrests in db.</li>
        <li>My goal currently with db is to great an AI or a machine learning that will calculate minimum required
            amount
            of
            strength to defeat a monster with out getting wounded. This is an excellent challenge because it has over 30
            factors to consider, it requires a huge amount of data that is why I will build it into a website. So other
            people can start feeding it data. After sometime I want the AI start asking questions from people to start
            improving itself. This challenge will force me to create a website that has a login, it will have several db
            that store information, it will have to be secure, it will teach me python (for connecting SQL to website),
            it
            will let me know what UI works and what doesn't. </li>
    </ul>
